# Chute-And-Ladders
The current code simulate the chute and ladders (I am assuming that the game is identical to snake and ladders).

## Assumptions
The game is identical to snake and ladders

## improvements
- Add a for incentives (If a user lands in a particular cell, they get to roll again)
- Add the ability to use more than one dice
- Allow users to roll the dice
